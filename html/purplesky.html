        <h3><a href="../html/purplesky.html">Purple Sky</a></h3>
        <p class="text">If you have stepped outside to see a purple sky (or even if you have just seen
         a photograph of one posted on social media), you might wonder what exactly
        creates this near-magical hue. But in order to understand what has turning
        the sky purple, you first need to know why the sky has any color at all.
        After all, air is colorless — so why does the sky (usually) look bright blue?

        In short, the sky gets its coloring thanks to a phenomenon called Rayleigh 
        scattering. This means that when wavelengths of light come into contact with 
        particles — even tiny, microscopic ones — in the atmosphere, they scatter in 
        different directions. This scattering effectively spreads the light. If the
         light has a visible color, that color then becomes more noticeable.
        
        As the image above illustrates, the white light of the sun is actually made
        up of several different colors, each with its own wavelength. Shorter 
        wavelengths are higher-energy forms of light that scatter more easily. 
        Blue light has a short wavelength, so it scatters easily, making the sky 
        look blue.
        
        So why are not sunsets blue? That has to do with the distance the sunos 
        rays need to travel through the atmosphere to reach us. Shorter wavelengths
        scatter first, and the sun is just the right distance from us to make that
         happen within our field of vision (at least during the day).</p>
