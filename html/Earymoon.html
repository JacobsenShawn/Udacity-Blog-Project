        <h3><a href="../html/Earymoon.html">Eary Moon</a></h3>
    <p class="text">The moon, which is relatively large compared to our planet, 
        is believed to have formed as a result of a collision between 
        Earth and a smaller Mars-sized planet, based on analysis of lunar
         samples and the similarities in composition between the moon and Earth.
          So, in a sense, the moon did collide with Earth in the past.

        Currently, the moon is not on a trajectory to crash into Earth.
         It is gradually moving away from Earth at about 1.5 inches per year. 
         The moon plays several important roles, such as stabilizing the tilt 
         of our orbit, causing seasonal changes, influencing tides, and aiding 
         nocturnal animal navigation. If the moon were to suddenly disappear,
          it would lead to significant environmental changes, and life on Earth,
           particularly animals, would face challenges in adapting to such drastic 
           shifts. However, due to its slow departure, we do not notice substantial 
           changes.
        <br>
        If, hypothetically, the moon were to crash into Earth, the consequences would 
        be dire for all life. To put it into perspective, the asteroid that caused the
         extinction of dinosaurs was approximately 12 km in diameter, whereas the moon
          has a diameter of about [2,174 miles] 3,500 km â€” roughly 300 times larger.
           However, there is a concept called the Roche limit, which represents the 
           minimum distance at which a large satellite (like the moon) can approach
            its primary body (Earth) without tidal forces tearing it apart. 
            At approximately 11,500 miles above Earth, the gravitational forces from
            Earth would overpower the gravitational forces holding the moon together,
            causing it to break apart. Over time, the moon's debris would rain down 
            on Earth, burning in the atmosphere and leading to a warming climate
            beyond what life could survive. Ultimately, this catastrophic event 
            could result in the extinction of life on Earth, except perhaps for 
            some extremophiles.</p>
